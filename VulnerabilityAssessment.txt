Note: To run a credentialed scan on the target, use the following credentials: htb-student_adm:HTB_@cademy_student! for Linux, and administrator:Academy_VA_adm1! for Windows. These scans have already been set up in the Nessus target to save you time.

Scripts such as the nessus-report-downloader can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST API:

Nessus gives us the option to export scan results in a variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan results to be imported into other tools, archived, or passed to tools, such as EyeWitness, which can be used to take screenshots of all web applications identified by Nessus and greatly assist us with working through the results and finding more value in them.
