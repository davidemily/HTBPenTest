The calculation of a CVSS v3.1 score takes into account all the metrics discussed in this section. The National Vulnerability Database has a calculator available to the public here.
  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator
  
For example, for the Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, CVSS Base Metrics is 8.8. You can reference the values of each metric value here.

Note: To run a credentialed scan on the target, use the following credentials: htb-student_adm:HTB_@cademy_student! for Linux, and administrator:Academy_VA_adm1! for Windows. These scans have already been set up in the Nessus target to save you time.

Scripts such as the nessus-report-downloader can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST API:

Nessus gives us the option to export scan results in a variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan results to be imported into other tools, archived, or passed to tools, such as EyeWitness, which can be used to take screenshots of all web applications identified by Nessus and greatly assist us with working through the results and finding more value in them.


It is also essential to keep in mind the potential impact of vulnerability scanning on a network, especially on low bandwidth or congested links. This can be measured using vnstat:
  sudo vnstat -l -i eth0
